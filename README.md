# Customer Segmentation for Arvato Financial Services

In this project, supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms are used to analyze demographical datasets of a general population as well as of customers of a German mail-order company. The goal of the project is twofold:

1. Cluster the datasets into groups to find out characteristics of existing customers and differences to general population
2. Develop a forecasting model to predict and identify prospective customer response for a marketing campaign

This is one of Udacityâ€™s capstone project for the Data Science Nanodegree program. The data is provided by Arvato Financial Services, a Bertelsmann subsidiary.
